# Utils

This directory contains a set of utiliy scripts
and libraries to assist in cactbot development.

Many are already referenced or documented
in the various project [docs](https://github.com/OverlayPlugin/cactbot/tree/main/docs).

You can run the most common scripts by running `npm run util`
from inside your cactbot root directory.
If you want to pass CLI arguments to the scripts,
use '--' so the args are treated as script args and not node args.
(e.g. `npm run generate -- -f all -ll debug`.
